# Snort Traffic Analysis

This repository contains the documentation and files related to the Snort Traffic Analysis lab

## Summary

In this lab, I performed various tasks to enhance my understanding of network security using Snort:

- Checked the headers of a PDF file and created an alert to detect it based on its header signature.
- Ran Snort with provided pcap files and successfully detected and logged alerts according to predefined rules.
- Explored the importance of file headers in identifying specific file formats.

The hands-on experience with Snort improved my skills in traffic analysis and network security.
